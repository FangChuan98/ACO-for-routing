# ACO-for-routing
A code demonstration of a simple ACO solving the routing problem.

file description
  1. field_node.mat
     a matrix stores the node data, including x-y coordnates and pv (potential values). PV can be interpreted as the priority in routing process.
  3. testAC.m
     load the data and perform a simple ACO to solve routing problems.

Note: This is just a simple demo with the basic framework of ACO.
